  <h2>1. Name and Contact Details of the Controller</h2>
  <p>
    The data controller within the meaning of the General Data Protection
    Regulation (GDPR) is:<br /><br />
    <strong>Susanne Renken</strong><br />

  </p>

  <h2>2. General Information on Data Processing</h2>
  <p>
    I take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Personal data is
    treated confidentially and in accordance with statutory data protection
    regulations and this Privacy Policy.<br /><br />
    “Personal data” means all information relating to an identified or
    identifiable natural person (e.g., name, address, e-mail address, IP
    address).
  </p>

  <h2>3. Access Data (Server Log Files)</h2>
  <p>
    When you visit this website, data may be collected automatically and stored
    in so-called server log files. This storage takes place, among other
    reasons, for security purposes (e.g., to clarify cases of misuse or fraud)
    and to ensure stable website operation. The following data may be logged:
  </p>
  <p>
    – Visited page or name of the requested file<br />
    – Date and time of access<br />
    – Transmitted data volume<br />
    – Source/referrer from which you arrived on the page<br />
    – Browser used (including version) and operating system<br />
    – IP address in anonymized form
  </p>
  <p>
    The processing is based on my legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f)
    GDPR, as these data are necessary for the operation and security of the
    website. These data are not merged with data from other sources.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Contact Form</h2>
  <p>
    If you send me inquiries using the contact form, the information you provide
    (in particular your name, e-mail address, and message) will be stored for
    the purpose of processing your request and for possible follow-up
    questions.<br /><br />
    The processing of data entered into the contact form is based on your
    consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR), if you provide it voluntarily, or in the
    context of a (pre)contractual relationship (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) if your
    inquiry is related to such a relationship. You may revoke your consent at
    any time by sending me an informal e-mail. The legality of any data
    processing carried out prior to your revocation remains unaffected.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Retention and Deletion of Personal Data</h2>
  <p>
    I only store personal data for as long as it is necessary to provide my
    services or as required by statutory retention periods (e.g., tax or
    commercial laws). Once the purpose of processing ceases or applicable
    retention periods expire, your data will be routinely deleted or blocked.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Disclosure of Data</h2>
  <p>
    Your personal data will only be disclosed to third parties if:<br />
    – it is necessary to fulfill contractual obligations (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR),<br />
    – I am required to do so by law or official/court orders (Art. 6(1)(c)
    GDPR),<br />
    – it is based on a legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) and there is no
    overriding legitimate interest on your part that opposes it, or<br />
    – you have explicitly consented (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).
  </p>
